Like Bagging and Random Forest (RF), AdaBoost combines the outputs of many classifiers into an ensemble, but there are some differences. In both Bagging and RF, each classifier in the ensemble is powerful but prone to overfitting. As Bagging or RF aggregate more and more classifiers, they reduce overfitting.\n","\n","With AdaBoost, each Classifier usually has performance slightly better than random. This is referred to as a weak learner or weak classifier. AdaBoost combines these classifiers to get a strong classifier. Unlike Bagging and Random Forest, in AdaBoost, adding more learners can cause overfitting. As a result, AdaBoost requires Hyperparameter tuning, taking more time to train. One advantage of AdaBoost is that each classifier is smaller, so predictions are faster.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8ea23baf-4034-4a25-a56c-859b2fa46611","metadata":{},"source":["In AdaBoost, the strong classifier $H(x)$ is a linear combination of $T$ weak classifiers $h_t(x)$ and $\\alpha_t$ as shown in (1). Although each classifier $h_t(x)$ appears independent, the $\\alpha_t$ contains information about the error of classifiers from $h_1(x),.., h_{t-1}(x)$. As we add more classifiers, the training accuracy gets larger. Whatâ€™s not so apparent in (1) is that during the training process, the values of that training sample are modified for $h_t(x)$.
